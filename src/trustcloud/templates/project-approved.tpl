Good News {{.Project.User.FirstName}},

We’ve done our evaluation and have certified {{.Project.Provider.Name}}. Your {{.Project.Job.Type}} job is eligible
for the TrustCloud PeerProtect™ service.

What is PeerProtect™?  It says that TrustCloud stands behind our certification of your service provider.  While we
only certify the best, home service jobs can be complex and things don’t always go as planned.  That’s where
PeerProtect comes in.  If you are unsatisfied with how your job goes or have some issue with your provider, then
just give us a call and let us help.

We will either get the provider to fix what’s wrong, get another provider to do so or reimburse you what
you’ve paid for the service - no matter what we will ensure you’re satisfied with your service.

For a small fee, you don’t have worry and can feel confident purchasing the service.

and satisfaction guarantee.
