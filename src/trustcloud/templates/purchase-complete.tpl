You’re Covered!
Here are the details of your satisfaction guarantee:

Project Type: {{.Project.Job.Type}}
Business/Contractor: {{.Project.Provider.Name}}
Cost Estimate: {{.Project.Job.DisplayableCost}}
Coverage Effective Date: {{.Project.Job.DisplayableStartDate}}

Remember, here’s how the PeerProtect™ guarantee works:

If {{.Project.Provider.Name}}’s work falls short of your expectations, TrustCloud will make it right.

Your guarantee is in effect as of {{.Project.Job.DisplayableStartDate}} and continues for 30 days thereafter.  Claims
must be filed within that period. You are covered for up to the cost of the job, {{.Project.Job.DisplayableCost}}. We
may require proof of work and payment to {{.Project.Provider.Name}} before processing your claim.

If you need to make a claim, call us at {{.Project.SupportPhone}}.
